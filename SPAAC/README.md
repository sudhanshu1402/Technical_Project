# SPAAC

## Problem Definition

In today’s time, there are several students who don’t pay attention during class lectures. Teacher can’t pay attention to each student specifically in the class.
So, to overcome this gap and to fill it we came up with the idea of this project - “Student Performance Analysis and Attention in Classroom (SPAAC).

## Objective

This project will approach automatic estimation of attendance and emotion expression of students along with the performance of students during lectures in the classroom. This approach will use real time Machine Learning algorithms and will generate a 2D data for students that uses the classroom cameras that identifies facial properties of a student. Machine learning algorithms are used to train classifiers which estimate time-varying attention levels of individual students.

## Dependencies

- Opencv
- Cmake
- Dlib
- face_recognition
- Keras
- CNN
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Imutils
- Statistics
- datetime
- matplotlib

## Requirement Analysis

- Teaching students offline is going to be difficult and tough after COVID-19. Students have become very comfortable with online education.
- Almost 95% of students are going to face difficulties studying offline after a long period of online education.
- Common problems that students are going to face is not giving proper attention, distraction in class, using phones and drowsiness.
- So, basically our software will be used by colleges, schools and universities.
- User would want to use our software to
  Monitor each student individually.
  Analyze the attention of every student.
  Easy attendance.
- Important aspects of our project:
  High accuracy
  Easy recognition
  Real time monitoring
