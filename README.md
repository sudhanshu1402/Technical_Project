STUDENT PERFORMANCE & ATTENTION ANALYSIS IN CLASS - (SPAAC)
~ a smart EYE for every Class


SPAAC is an idea to make a real time system which can calculate student attendance along with its performance (i.e., happy, neutral, sad or angry) in the classroom with the help of classroom CCTV using facial recognition algorithms along with deep learning to achieve better results. 

This system will capture students through a CCTV camera present in the classroom and generate emotions based on their expression in class. Algorithms like CNN, Image Classification, Score Prediction, Face Recognition, Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Accuracy and Prediction are used. During the first phase we have studied various aspects and implemented a very basic facial recognition program to recognize the individual.   

Face systems with artificial intelligence are dramatically changing businesses. There is a wide range of face system building platforms that are available for various enterprises, such as e-commerce, retail, banking, leisure, travel, healthcare, and so on.
